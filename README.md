# Aaple-Stock-Price-Predtiction-with-LSTM-

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict future stock prices based on historical data. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time-series forecasting, such as predicting stock prices.

🔍 Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Load and preprocess historical stock price data

Build and train an LSTM model to predict future closing prices

Visualize the results and evaluate model performance

🧰 Tech Stack
Python 3.x

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

yfinance (for fetching stock data)

📊 Dataset
The data is sourced using the yfinance library, which provides historical stock price data including:

Open

High

Low

Close

Volume

You can replace the stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, GOOG, etc.) to work with any company listed on Yahoo Finance.

🧠 Model Architecture
The LSTM model consists of:

One or more LSTM layers

Dropout layers (for regularization)

A Dense output layer
